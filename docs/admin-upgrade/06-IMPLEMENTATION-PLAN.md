## Migration Strategy

### Backward Compatibility Plan

#### 1. API Versioning (Backend)

```javascript
// Old endpoint (keep for compatibility)
GET /api/admin/users

// New endpoint with pagination
GET /api/admin/users/paginated?page=1&limit=20
```

**Strategy:** Keep old endpoints working, introduce new ones alongside

#### 2. State Shape Migration (Redux)

**Old State:**
```javascript
{
  users: [],
  loading: false,
  error: null,
}
```

**New State:**
```javascript
{
  users: [],
  pagination: { page: 1, total: 0, pages: 0 },
  filters: {},
  loading: false,
  error: null,
}
```

**Migration:** Add new fields without removing old ones initially

#### 3. Component Migration

**Strategy:** Create new components alongside old ones, gradually replace

```
src/features/admin/components/users/
├── UserList.jsx              // Old component (keep temporarily)
├── UserListV2.jsx            // New component
├── index.js                  // Export new as default
└── legacy/                   // Move old component here after migration
    └── UserList.jsx
```

### Data Migration

#### Audit Log Schema (Backend)

```javascript
// Add new collection: auditLogs
{
  userId: ObjectId,
  userName: String,
  action: String,         // CREATE, UPDATE, DELETE, APPROVE, REJECT
  category: String,       // USER_MANAGEMENT, SUBJECT_MANAGEMENT, etc.
  resourceType: String,   // User, Subject, Application, etc.
  resourceId: ObjectId,
  details: Object,        // Action-specific details
  ipAddress: String,
  userAgent: String,
  timestamp: Date,
}
```

**Migration Script:**
- No existing data migration needed (new feature)
- Add indexes on userId, timestamp, category

---

## Feature Flags

### Implementation

**File:** `src/utils/featureFlags.js`

```javascript
/**
 * Feature flags for gradual rollout
 */
const FEATURES = {
  NEW_DASHBOARD: 'new_dashboard',
  BULK_OPERATIONS: 'bulk_operations',
  ADVANCED_FILTERING: 'advanced_filtering',
  REAL_TIME_UPDATES: 'real_time_updates',
  ANALYTICS_DASHBOARD: 'analytics_dashboard',
};

// Feature flag configuration
const featureFlags = {
  [FEATURES.NEW_DASHBOARD]: {
    enabled: process.env.VITE_FF_NEW_DASHBOARD === 'true',
    rolloutPercentage: 100, // 0-100
  },
  [FEATURES.BULK_OPERATIONS]: {
    enabled: process.env.VITE_FF_BULK_OPS === 'true',
    rolloutPercentage: 50, // Gradual rollout to 50% of users
  },
  [FEATURES.ADVANCED_FILTERING]: {
    enabled: true, // Fully enabled
    rolloutPercentage: 100,
  },
  [FEATURES.REAL_TIME_UPDATES]: {
    enabled: false, // Not yet ready
    rolloutPercentage: 0,
  },
  [FEATURES.ANALYTICS_DASHBOARD]: {
    enabled: process.env.VITE_FF_ANALYTICS === 'true',
    rolloutPercentage: 10, // Beta testing with 10% of users
  },
};

/**
 * Check if a feature is enabled for the current user
 */
export const isFeatureEnabled = (feature, userId = null) => {
  const flag = featureFlags[feature];
  
  if (!flag || !flag.enabled) {
    return false;
  }

  // If rollout percentage is less than 100, use user-based rollout
  if (flag.rolloutPercentage < 100 && userId) {
    // Simple hash-based rollout (consistent per user)
    const userHash = hashCode(userId) % 100;
    return userHash < flag.rolloutPercentage;
  }

  return true;
};

function hashCode(str) {
  let hash = 0;
  for (let i = 0; i < str.length; i++) {
    const char = str.charCodeAt(i);
    hash = (hash << 5) - hash + char;
    hash = hash & hash;
  }
  return Math.abs(hash);
}

export { FEATURES };
```

### Usage

```jsx
import { isFeatureEnabled, FEATURES } from '@/utils/featureFlags';
import { useSelector } from 'react-redux';

const AdminDashboard = () => {
  const { user } = useSelector(state => state.auth);
  const showNewDashboard = isFeatureEnabled(FEATURES.NEW_DASHBOARD, user._id);

  return showNewDashboard ? <NewDashboard /> : <OldDashboard />;
};
```

### Environment Variables

**.env.development:**
```
VITE_FF_NEW_DASHBOARD=true
VITE_FF_BULK_OPS=true
VITE_FF_ANALYTICS=true
```

**.env.production:**
```
VITE_FF_NEW_DASHBOARD=false  # Disable until ready
VITE_FF_BULK_OPS=false
VITE_FF_ANALYTICS=false
```

## Rollout Plan

### Gradual Rollout Strategy

#### Phase 1: Internal Testing (Week 11)
- Enable all features for development team
- Test in staging environment
- Fix critical bugs
- Performance validation

#### Phase 2: Beta Testing (Week 12)
- Enable features for 10% of admin users
- Monitor error rates and performance
- Gather feedback
- Iterate on issues

#### Phase 3: Gradual Rollout (Weeks 13-14)
- Week 13: Roll out to 50% of users
- Monitor metrics daily
- Address issues quickly
- Prepare for full rollout

#### Phase 4: Full Release (Week 15)
- Enable for 100% of users
- Monitor for 48 hours
- Remove feature flags
- Delete old code

### Rollback Plan

**Quick Rollback (< 5 minutes):**
1. Change environment variable: `VITE_FF_NEW_DASHBOARD=false`
2. Redeploy frontend (Vite build is fast)
3. Monitor error rates

**Full Rollback (if needed):**
1. Revert to previous commit: `git revert <commit>`
2. Deploy old version
3. Investigate issues
4. Fix and re-deploy

## Risk Management

### Risk Matrix

| Risk | Impact | Probability | Mitigation |
|------|--------|-------------|------------|
| **Data loss during migration** | Critical | Low | Backup database, test migrations thoroughly |
| **Performance regression** | High | Medium | Performance budgets, profiling, rollback plan |
| **Breaking existing features** | High | Medium | Comprehensive testing, feature flags, gradual rollout |
| **Security vulnerabilities** | Critical | Low | Security audits, penetration testing, code reviews |
| **User adoption resistance** | Medium | Medium | Training, documentation, feedback loops |
| **Browser compatibility issues** | Medium | Low | Cross-browser testing, graceful degradation |
| **Third-party library issues** | Medium | Low | Lock dependency versions, have alternatives ready |
| **Timeline delays** | Medium | High | Buffer time, prioritize ruthlessly, MVP approach |

### Contingency Plans

**If Timeline Slips:**
1. Prioritize Phase 1 (security) and Phase 2 (performance)
2. Defer Phase 5 (analytics) to future sprint
3. Reduce scope of Phase 4 (advanced features)

**If Critical Bug in Production:**
1. Immediate rollback via feature flag
2. Hot-fix branch created
3. Fix, test, and deploy within 24 hours

**If User Feedback is Negative:**
1. Gather specific feedback
2. Prioritize top 3 issues
3. Quick iteration cycle (48-hour fixes)
4. Re-test with users
